= Misiones

Misiones generates LeafletJS map data for historic missions and paths.  It is indended
as the main build tool for the El Destino dataset (https://github.com/potano/elDestino),
which generates a map for the El Destino plantation and the Spanish missions that had
been in the area.  Given its ability to alter the displayed map style of features
according to their historical attestations, *misiones* should be able to find wider
use.

The output of *misiones* is a Javascript source file (not strict JSON) to be read into
a main Javascript application that feeds the generated data into a LeafletJS map.

See the link:doc/[doc/] directory for program usage and source-data format.

Building *misiones* requires only a recent Go compiler (https://go.dev/dl).  The
process is slightly easier if the _make_ command is available and the target
architecture and OS are the same as that of the installed Go compiler.

* Using _make_

Run `make` in the main directory and copy the generated program, `bin/misiones` to
the location where it should be deployed.

Runing `make install` will install the build the program and install it to the
proper place on a Unix-like system.  Also installs the _man_ and _info_ pages.

* Using the Go compiler

Run `go build bin/misiones.go` in the main directory and copy the generated
program, `misiones` to the location where it should be deployed.  Set the _GOARCH_
and _GOOS_ environment variables as needed if cross-compiling for a different
architecture and/or OS.
